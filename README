vkbd is a virtual keyboard that allow userland applications to send keyboard event to system in a very easy way.
When insmoding the vkbd.ko module, the /sys/class/vkbd entry is created. 
- One can create a new virtual keyboard device by echoing anything into export
- One can remove an existing virtual keyboard device by echoing its id into unexport

After that, one just need to write the keycode inside the /dev/vkbdX node.
vkbd uses a simple format: "%+d"
A positive value means KEY_PRESS and a negative one means KEY_RELEASE.

ex: simulate a key press on "g" (KEY_G = 34 )
	$> echo +34 > /proc/kbd

ex: simulate a key release on "g" (KEY_G = 34 )
	$> echo -34 > /proc/kbd

The keycodes list can be retrieved from /usr/include/linux/input.h
